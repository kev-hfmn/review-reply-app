# Lemon Squeezy Integration Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the Lemon Squeezy migration. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth transition from Stripe to Lemon Squeezy.

## Prerequisites

1. ✅ Database migration executed (`docs/migrations/lemon_squeezy_migration.sql`)
2. ✅ Lemon Squeezy environment variables configured
3. ✅ Lemon Squeezy products and variants created
4. ✅ Webhook endpoint configured in Lemon Squeezy dashboard

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Testing (Feature Flag = false)

**Objective**: Ensure existing Stripe functionality remains intact.

#### Test 1.1: Existing Stripe Checkout Flow
```bash
# Ensure feature flag is disabled
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LEMON_SQUEEZY=false
```

**Steps**:
1. Restart development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/profile` 
3. Click "Upgrade to Pro" button
4. Verify Stripe checkout opens
5. Complete test payment using Stripe test card: `4242424242424242`
6. Verify redirect to success page
7. Check subscription appears in database with `payment_processor = 'stripe'`

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Stripe checkout loads normally
- ✅ Payment processes successfully
- ✅ User subscription status updates correctly
- ✅ No errors in console or server logs

#### Test 1.2: Existing Webhook Processing
**Steps**:
1. Trigger Stripe webhook events (subscription created, updated, cancelled)
2. Monitor server logs for webhook processing
3. Verify subscription status updates correctly

### Phase 2: Lemon Squeezy Integration Testing (Feature Flag = true)

**Objective**: Validate new Lemon Squeezy functionality.

#### Test 2.1: Environment Configuration
```bash
# Enable Lemon Squeezy
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LEMON_SQUEEZY=true
```

**Verification Checklist**:
- ✅ `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY` is set
- ✅ `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID` is set  
- ✅ `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set
- ✅ All `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEMONSQUEEZY_*_VARIANT_ID` variables are set
- ✅ Restart development server after setting variables

#### Test 2.2: Lemon Squeezy Checkout Flow
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/profile`
2. Click "Upgrade to Starter" button
3. Verify Lemon Squeezy checkout opens (not Stripe)
4. Complete test payment using Lemon Squeezy test card
5. Verify redirect to success page with `?payment=success&source=lemonsqueezy`
6. Check subscription appears in database with `payment_processor = 'lemonsqueezy'`

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Lemon Squeezy checkout loads (different UI than Stripe)
- ✅ Payment processes successfully
- ✅ Correct redirect URL with Lemon Squeezy parameters
- ✅ Subscription created with correct payment processor

#### Test 2.3: Webhook Event Processing
**Steps**:
1. Complete a Lemon Squeezy checkout
2. Monitor server logs at `/api/lemonsqueezy/webhook`
3. Verify webhook events are processed:
   - `subscription_created`
   - `order_created` (optional)

**Webhook Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Monitor webhook logs in real-time
tail -f /var/log/your-app.log | grep "lemonsqueezy"

# Or check server console for webhook events
# Look for: "Processing Lemon Squeezy webhook event: subscription_created"
```

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Webhook signature validation passes
- ✅ Events are not processed twice (deduplication works)
- ✅ Subscription data is correctly stored
- ✅ Custom data (user_id) is preserved

### Phase 3: Dual System Testing

**Objective**: Verify both systems can operate simultaneously.

#### Test 3.1: Mixed Subscription Handling
**Scenario**: Test with users having both Stripe and Lemon Squeezy subscriptions.

**Setup**:
1. Create test user with existing Stripe subscription
2. Switch feature flag: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LEMON_SQUEEZY=true`  
3. Same user attempts to upgrade/change plan

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ System detects existing active subscription
- ✅ Prevents duplicate subscription creation
- ✅ AuthContext correctly identifies subscription status regardless of processor

#### Test 3.2: Subscription Status Detection
**Steps**:
1. Create subscriptions with both payment processors
2. Test various subscription states:
   - Active Stripe subscription
   - Active Lemon Squeezy subscription  
   - Cancelled but not expired subscription
   - Expired subscription

**Verification**:
```javascript
// Check AuthContext subscription detection
console.log(useAuth().isSubscriber); // Should be true/false correctly
```

### Phase 4: Edge Case Testing

#### Test 4.1: Error Handling
**Test Cases**:

1. **Invalid Variant ID**:
   ```javascript
   // Temporarily set invalid variant ID
   NEXT_PUBLIC_LEMONSQUEEZY_STARTER_VARIANT_ID=invalid_id
   ```
   - ✅ Should show user-friendly error message
   - ✅ Should not crash the application

2. **Network Failures**:
   - Disconnect internet during checkout
   - ✅ Should handle timeout gracefully

3. **Webhook Signature Validation**:
   - Send webhook with invalid signature
   - ✅ Should reject with 400 status

#### Test 4.2: Database Integrity
**Steps**:
1. Run multiple concurrent checkouts
2. Verify no duplicate subscriptions created
3. Check database constraints are enforced

**SQL Verification**:
```sql
-- Check for duplicate Lemon Squeezy subscriptions
SELECT lemonsqueezy_subscription_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM subscriptions 
WHERE lemonsqueezy_subscription_id IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY lemonsqueezy_subscription_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Should return no rows
```

### Phase 5: Performance Testing

#### Test 5.1: Checkout Performance
**Metrics to Monitor**:
- Checkout creation time (< 2 seconds)
- Webhook processing time (< 1 second)
- Page load time after feature flag change

#### Test 5.2: Webhook Reliability
**Steps**:
1. Create multiple subscriptions rapidly
2. Monitor webhook processing logs
3. Verify all events are processed exactly once

### Phase 6: User Experience Testing

#### Test 6.1: Feature Flag Switching
**Steps**:
1. Start with Stripe (`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LEMON_SQUEEZY=false`)
2. Complete a checkout flow
3. Switch to Lemon Squeezy (`NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LEMON_SQUEEZY=true`)
4. Restart server and test checkout again
5. Verify both types of subscriptions work correctly

#### Test 6.2: Customer Portal Integration
**Steps**:
1. Create Lemon Squeezy subscription
2. Verify customer portal URLs are generated correctly
3. Test update payment method URLs

## Production Deployment Testing

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass in development environment
- [ ] Database migration applied to production
- [ ] Production Lemon Squeezy environment variables set
- [ ] Production webhook endpoint configured
- [ ] Feature flag initially set to `false`

### Deployment Steps
1. **Deploy with Stripe Active**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LEMON_SQUEEZY=false
   ```

2. **Smoke Test Production**:
   - Test existing Stripe functionality
   - Verify no regressions

3. **Enable Lemon Squeezy**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LEMON_SQUEEZY=true
   ```

4. **Monitor Production**:
   - Watch webhook logs
   - Monitor error rates
   - Check subscription creation rates

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Immediately set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_LEMON_SQUEEZY=false`
2. Redeploy application
3. Investigate issues in development
4. Re-test before re-enabling

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Subscription creation success rate
- Webhook processing success rate  
- Payment failure rates
- Customer support ticket volume

### Log Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Monitor Lemon Squeezy API calls
grep "Lemon Squeezy" /var/log/app.log

# Monitor webhook processing
grep "webhook" /var/log/app.log | grep "lemonsqueezy"

# Monitor errors
grep "ERROR" /var/log/app.log | grep -E "(lemonsqueezy|stripe)"
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Webhook Signature Validation Fails
**Symptoms**: 400 errors from webhook endpoint
**Solution**: 
- Verify `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches dashboard
- Check webhook URL is exactly: `/api/lemonsqueezy/webhook`

### Issue 2: Feature Flag Not Taking Effect  
**Symptoms**: Still using Stripe after enabling flag
**Solution**:
- Restart Next.js development server
- Clear browser cache
- Verify environment variable has `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix

### Issue 3: Duplicate Subscriptions
**Symptoms**: Multiple active subscriptions per user
**Solution**:
- Check unique constraints in database
- Verify duplicate prevention logic in checkout route
- Review webhook deduplication

## Testing Completion Checklist

- [ ] All Stripe functionality preserved
- [ ] Lemon Squeezy checkout works end-to-end
- [ ] Webhook processing is reliable
- [ ] Database integrity maintained
- [ ] Error handling is graceful
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Feature flag switching works smoothly
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Monitoring is in place

## Post-Migration Validation

After successful migration:
1. Monitor for 1-2 weeks
2. Compare subscription metrics between Stripe and Lemon Squeezy
3. Collect user feedback on checkout experience
4. Plan Stripe deprecation (if desired)
