-- Mock Data for Flowrise Reviews
-- Execute this after the main schema to populate with sample data
-- Replace 'YOUR_USER_ID' with your actual auth.users.id

-- First, let's assume we have a test user. You'll need to replace this with your actual user ID
-- You can get your user ID by running: SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR ACTUAL USER ID FROM auth.users table
-- Example: SET @user_id = '12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc';
